Hello!
This repository contains the code used to generate the figures in my ultrasound lab report.

Open GenFigs.ipynb (can be done in the browswer) to see how all figures were generated and the trigonotmeric engines were called. To find the tigonometric engines, explore the bmfrm/trigengines folder

If you have any questions, please contact me at wew12@duke.edu
